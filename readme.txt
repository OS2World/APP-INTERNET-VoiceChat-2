Current Version is  .07 alpha using port 7551.


Start the application by typeing  vc2.exe  on a command line.

dialin.exe and dialout.exe are not for HUMAN use.

TIA Users, sexchoc ( IRC #os/2 ) has found that you can use VoiceChat/2
with TIA, on Solaris systems;

  the port used by VoiceChat/2 Ver .06.2 alpha is 7551.

THIS WILL CHANGE, but for now , good luck, and bug sexchoc about TIA support,
 not us.

Remember this is in BETA stage, and since the demand for this program is so
high, we are releasing it early, this doesnt mean we get yelled at for releasing
buggy code.

 We will NOT be held responsible for ANYTHING that might go wrong...
  ...but on a plus note, no one has had there system reboot on them, except
  me :)

         Peace,  Stephen

PS: Mail me with suggestions for TCP/IP or compression questions or suggestions
    Save the PM questions, suggestions, complaints for Dan.  Thanks 

If U had a previous version of voicechat/2 installed, the dialog boxes will
not show up correctly in this version.

To rectify this, you must use a program capable of editing your OS2.INI file.
(inimaint) from hobbes.nmsu.edu is a good tool.
Find VoiceChat/2 listed in the applications list in the ini file.  Under 
keywords, you will find Position, Options, and Dial Out.  Delete Options and
Dial Out, and leave Position.  This SHOULD (no guarantees) leave your main
application window with the same fonts/colors/size as before, while setting
the dialog boxes back to default.

Good Luck!
            Dan

PS: [Sophisto] If you can, DELETE the application reference to VoiceChat/2 from
               OS2.INI before running this new version.
